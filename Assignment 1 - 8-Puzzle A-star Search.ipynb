        "In _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ by Russel and Norvig, a reference is made to _Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays; Vol. 2_ by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy (Academic Press, London, 1982). Based on that suggestion, we start by looking at the number of inversions required to order the state.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each flattened state, we compare each tile with the tiles after it. For any tile of smaller value, excluding the blank, we increment our inversion count once. Since our target quantity will take one of two values, we look at the parity of that count. \n",
        "\n",
        "We now have to look at different scenarios, for odd and even state dimensions, to check that the parity is invariant to any valid move.\n",
        "\n",
        "__For odd $n$__\n",
        " \n",
        "A move sideways will always be expressed in flattened form as the the blank switching places with an adjacent tile, which cannot affect our inversion count since the blank is not taken into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "A move up or down will switch the blank with tile that's an even distance $(n-1)$ to either direction. The switched tile can only jump over an even number strictly larger or strictly smaller tiles, resulting in an increment or decrement of 2 to the count, or over a combination of smaller and larger tiles that add up to no increment to the count, or a combination of these. Ultimately, with all moves contributing even increments to the count, parity is conserved.\n",
        "\n",
        "__For even $n$__\n",
        "\n",
        "We start similarly, with a sideways move contributing nothing to the inversion count. However, an up or down move will skip over n-1 tiles, an odd distance. This will result in similar interactions as in the odd $n$ scenario, only with an added increment to the count that doesn't have a partner to cancel out or add up with, and therefore up and down moves are odd, reversing the parity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thankfully this can easily be fixed by adding another quantity to the inversion count, that only changes parity with up and down moves. This is simply the row distance, the distance of the blank tile's current row from the first row. It's easy to see that the parity of the row count is invariant to sideways moves, and reverses with up and down moves. Therefore,  the parity of the combined quantity of inversion count and row distance, instead of simply the inversion count, will always be conserved in solvable and unsolvable states for even n. \n",
        "\n",
        "We therefore implemented a solvability checking function using the above proof as justification, and incorporated it into our validity checking function. Since in a solved state the inversion count and the row count are zero, the invariant is zero and therefore even for all solvable states.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Solvabilization__\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also quickly prove for ourselves that any unsolved state can be changed into a solved state, and vice versa, by switching any two adjacent non-blank tiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "For both parities of n, a sideways moves will result in an increment or decrement of 1 in the parity count, since either a larger tile rises above a smaller tile, or vice versa. The tiles above or below the pair won't notice a difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "An up and down move will also not be registered by tiles above or below the switched pair, but will affect the tiles in between. To simplify this double switch, we simply describe it as two instances of the regular, blank tile up or down move:\n",
        "\n",
        "For odd n, an up or down move skips over a even number of tiles, and so will two such moves, as two evens add up to an even. Therefore, this results in an even change to the inversion count. For even n, an up or down move skips over an odd number of tiles, but two such moves skip over an even amount of tiles, as to odds also add up to an even. This then also results in an even change to the inversion count. The effect of the switches cancel out.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, when we factor in the effect of the switched tiles on one another, we see the same situation as a sideways move added on top of the switch, again resulting in a total increment or decrement of 1 to the inversion count.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore a switch of adjacent non-blank tiles to any direction always inverses the parity of the conserved quantity, effectively swtiching between solvable and unsolvable states.\n"
